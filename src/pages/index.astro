			<h1>Welcome to my Page</h1>
			<p>
				Hi, I am Comrade PS2 or King Playstation. I am a junior high school student from Bangladesh. <br>
				I love Programming, Gaming, and Tinkering with stuff. I am currently learning OS Development and Cooking skills.
			</p>
			<h1>My Projects</h1>
			<p>
				Here are some of my notable projects that I have worked on:
			    1. XylenOS - A hobbyist operating system that I am developing with my friend Kebap
				2. PyPass - A password manager that I am developing.
			<p>
				This template comes with a few integrations already configured in your
				<code>astro.config.mjs</code> file. You can customize your setup with
				<a href="https://astro.build/integrations">Astro Integrations</a> to add tools like Tailwind,
				React, or Vue to your project.
			</p>
			<p>Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Edit this page in <code>src/pages/index.astro</code></li>
				<li>Edit the site header items in <code>src/components/Header.astro</code></li>
				<li>Add your name to the footer in <code>src/components/Footer.astro</code></li>
				<li>Check out the included blog posts in <code>src/content/blog/</code></li>
				<li>Customize the blog post page layout in <code>src/layouts/BlogPost.astro</code></li>
			</ul>
